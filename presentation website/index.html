                        <dt><b>Step 1:</b></dt>
                        <dd>After countless field tests, extensive Google research, and restaurant spying,<br> I have finally developed a recipe that tastes absolutely authentic and delicious—just like in Bella Italia!</dd>
                        <dt><b>Step2</b></dt>
                        <dd>First, sift the flour with the salt and pour it into a dough mixer or bread maker<br> with a dough function. Now dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and then add it to the flour and salt mixture (note from the <br> Chefkoch.de team recipe editing: The amount of yeast specified is correct and it is fresh yeast).</dd>
                        <dt><b>Step 3:</b></dt>
                        <dd>Then knead the ingredients for 20 (!) minutes to form an elastic, homogeneous dough.<br> Note: An electric mixer is almost essential here, but a hand mixer with dough hooks will do in a pinch.<br> Please do not attempt to knead by hand, as the dough will not achieve the desired softness and consistency.</dd>
                        <dt><b>Step 4:</b></dt>
                        <dd>After kneading, cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for two hours.<br> Then divide it into four 200 g pieces, shape them into balls, cover them again, and let them rise for another six hours.</dd>
                        <dt><b>Step 5:</b></dt>
                        <dd>So what is so special about this dough recipe? The secret lies not in exquisite <br> ingredients such as expensive pizza flour or high-quality olive oil, nor in superfluous ingredients such as beer, sugar, or eggs.<br> Rather, the smooth texture is achieved through long machine kneading! The extremely small amount of yeast,<br> together with the long fermentation, ensures an extremely aromatic dough.</dd>
                        <dt><b>Step 6:</b></dt>
                        <dd>Finally, a few tips for further processing: Roll out or stretch the dough as thinly <br> as possible! Anything less than 4 mm is ideal.</dd>
                        <dt><b>Step 7:</b></dt>
                        <dd>For the tomato sauce, simply puree a can of peeled tomatoes with (lots of) garlic, salt,<br> pepper, a little sugar, basil, and oregano while cold; do not cook. Then spread it in the center of the pizza and spread it<br> over the entire pizza in circular motions with a ladle. Don't use too much! A good pizza should not be<br> drowned in tomato sauce. If some areas of the dough don't get any sauce, it doesn't matter.<br> It's better to have a little less than a little more.</dd>
                        <dt><b>Step 8:</b></dt>
                        <dd>Preheat the oven to the highest setting! Mine reaches just under 260 °C, and the result<br> was great. Place the dough on the hot baking sheet (it's easier with baking paper) and<br> after just 3-4 minutes, the pizza is ready to enjoy.</dd>
